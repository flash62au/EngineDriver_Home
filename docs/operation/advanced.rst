Consist Follow Functions
------------------------

By default, in |ed|, if you activate a DCC function while controlling a Consist/Multiple Unit train only the function on the lead loco will actually be activated.
Engine Driver provides options (preferences) that will activate the functions on the other locos in the consist/multiple unit train given a number of possible rules.
The following document provides information on the different rule types and how to use them.

See the :doc:`Consist Follow Functions <consist-follow-functions>` page for details.

Children's Timer
----------------

|ED| provides options for time controlled running.  This was originally intended for providing a way to have children have a fair share of the use of a loco, but can be used for timed control for any purpose.

Instructions:

- select the loco first.
- enable the time limited running to the desired time, using either:
  
  - the `Time limited running <../configuration/preferences.html#time-limited-running>`_ preference, (then return to the |T-S|) |br| *or* 
  - the action button (`Show Timer button? <../configuration/preferences.html#show-timer-button>`_)
  
- The timer will start with the first increase in speed
- When the timer runs out:

  - You must come back to this preference to reset the time (or clear it) |br| *or* 
  - click the action button again.
 
Recommendations:

- Enable the Action Bar button (`Show Timer button? <../configuration/preferences.html#show-timer-button>`_)
- Disable the hardware volume keys (`Disable Volume keys? <./configuration/preferences.html#disable-volume-keys>`_)
- Disable `Swipe Through Turnouts/Points? <./configuration/preferences.html#swipe-through-turnouts-points>`_ 
- Disable `Swipe Through Routes? <./configuration/preferences.html#swipe-through-routes>`_
- Disable the `Emergency Stop button? <./configuration/preferences.html#throttle-screen-action-bar-preferences>`_
