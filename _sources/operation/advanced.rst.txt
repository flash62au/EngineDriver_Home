Children's Timer
----------------

|ED| provides options for time controlled running.  This was originally intended for providing a way to have children have a fair share of the use of a loco, but can be used for timed control for any purpose.

Instructions:

- select the loco first.
- enable the time limited running to the desired time, using either:
  
  - the `Time limited running <../configuration/preferences.html#time-limited-running>`_ preference, (then return to the |T-S|) |br| *or* 
  - the action button (`Show Timer button? <../configuration/preferences.html#show-timer-button>`_)
  
- The timer will start with the first increase in speed
- When the timer runs out:

  - You must come back to this preference to reset the time (or clear it) |br| *or* 
  - click the action button again.
 
Recommendations:

- Enable the Action Bar button (`Show Timer button? <../configuration/preferences.html#show-timer-button>`_)
- Disable the hardware volume keys (`Disable Volume keys? <./configuration/preferences.html#disable-volume-keys>`_)
- Disable `Swipe Through Turnouts/Points? <./configuration/preferences.html#swipe-through-turnouts-points>`_ 
- Disable `Swipe Through Routes? <./configuration/preferences.html#swipe-through-routes>`_
- Disable the `Emergency Stop button? <./configuration/preferences.html#throttle-screen-action-bar-preferences>`_

The following preferences allow you to change the way the *Children's (Timer)* behave.
